## Snippets Bar

> A desktop menubar app for copying, pasting and re-using text snippets

heavily inspired to:

[teesloane/snippet-bar](https://github.com/teesloane/snippet-bar#snippet-bar)

### Goal

I used teesloane snippets-bar for a long time, but there were some things that simply did not make sense to me, such as:

- The app always stayed on top when I opened it
- There was no support for Mac OS dark theme (causing the tray icon to be not visible)
- No keyboard shortcuts

As apparently the project was left behind by the creator, I decided to create a new version that solved all these issues by myself.

### Features

- The app now closes when the window is not focused
- Supports MacOs dark and light themes (also on the fly!)
- A bunch of keyboard shortcuts to speed up the creation / editing / copying of the snippets

### Which platforms are supported?

Snippet Bar currently works only on Mac, not yet sure if I'll add more platforms in the future.

Download the last version from the [releases](https://github.com/AlbaOngaro/snippets-bar/releases) page!

### Roadmap

The app now is working pretty good, but there still are some features I'd like to add in the future:

- Add folders
- Add settings for personalising the app

### Technologies ü§ì

- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
- [menubar](https://github.com/maxogden/menubar)
- [xstate](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate)
- Typescript
